# After defining the tools, we place them in a list and bind them (equivalent to passing arguments) to the LLM object to run
# We use format_tool_to_openai_function to render our list of tools specifically for OpenAI function calling. 
# Under the hood, it formats the tools into a dictionary structure based on their name, description, and any other arguments we pass.
